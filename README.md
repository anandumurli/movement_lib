# movement_lib
Chess piece movement mechanism using arduino
The inspiration for this type of movement was taken from the movement pattern of 3D printer
hence the mechanincal movement is completely based on the 3D printer's ejection module.
The library needs an input address as an argument and from there the file moves the app
